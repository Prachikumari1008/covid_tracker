# Covid Tracker



## Introduction

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. Along the way, we will use Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, API data fetching, all of it in React JS!

The project is going to fetch the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax.

We used following API :

https://covid19.mathdro.id/api
https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/countries/
https://covid19.mathdro.id/api/daily
